# HoneyBook Integration Guide

## Overview

Your website now has a professional lead capture form that collects detailed project information. This guide will help you integrate it with HoneyBook for automated lead management.

## Current Setup

- ✅ Professional contact form with project details
- ✅ Introductory offer banner highlighting new business status
- ✅ Softened language to be more approachable
- ✅ Email-based lead capture (opens user's email client)

## HoneyBook Integration Options

### Option 1: Form Integration (Recommended)

**Replace the current form with HoneyBook's embedded contact form**

1. **Log into HoneyBook**
2. **Go to Tools > Contact Forms**
3. **Create a new contact form** with these fields:
   - Name, Email, Phone
   - Project Type (dropdown)
   - Location
   - Timeline
   - Budget Range
   - Project Details
4. **Get the embed code**
5. **Replace the current form in `index.html`** with HoneyBook's embed code

### Option 2: Zapier Integration

**Keep current form but send data to HoneyBook via Zapier**

1. **Set up Zapier account**
2. **Create integration**: Website Form → HoneyBook
3. **Configure form submission webhook**
4. **Update `contact-form.js` to send data to Zapier**

### Option 3: Manual Process (Current)

**Continue with email notifications and manually enter leads into HoneyBook**

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: HoneyBook Setup

1. Sign up for HoneyBook account
2. Set up your service offerings:
   - Real Estate Photography
   - RV Park Marketing
   - Destination Content
   - Commercial Properties
   - Event Coverage
3. Create proposal templates for each service
4. Set up automated workflows for new leads

### Step 2: Form Replacement

When ready to integrate, replace this section in `index.html`:

```html
<!-- Replace this entire form section -->
<form id="leadForm" action="#" method="POST">
  <!-- Current form content -->
</form>
```

With HoneyBook's embed code (something like):

```html
<!-- HoneyBook embed code will go here -->
<iframe
  src="https://app.honeybook.com/forms/YOUR-FORM-ID"
  width="100%"
  height="600px"
  frameborder="0"
>
</iframe>
```

### Step 3: Styling Updates

You may need to adjust CSS to match HoneyBook's form styling:

```css
/* Add to styles.css */
.honeybook-form iframe {
  border-radius: 12px;
  box-shadow: 0 10px 30px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.1);
}
```

## Lead Management Workflow

### Automated HoneyBook Process:

1. **Lead submits form** → Creates HoneyBook inquiry
2. **Automated email** → Sends welcome message with intro offer details
3. **Follow-up sequence** → Automated reminder emails
4. **Proposal creation** → Use templates for quick quotes
5. **Contract & payment** → All handled within HoneyBook

### Intro Offer Integration:

- Set up "New Business Special" package in HoneyBook
