          <h3>Sr. Backend Engineer</h3>
          <span>Included Health (formerly Doctor On Demand) - San Francisco, CA |
            October 2017 to November 2024</span>
          <p class="entry-subtitle">🌟 Practice Management Engineering Team</p>
          <p>
            Worked on the Practice Management engineering team to transition
            from legacy technology to a modern, microservice-oriented
            architecture. This project replaced an outdated in-house EHR
            (Electronic Health Record) with a third-party system, enabling
            integration and greater flexibility for future innovation.
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              Developed and maintained <strong>Golang microservices</strong> to streamline practitioner management,
              scheduling/availability, and data synchronization between legacy systems and the EHR.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented <strong>Temporal workflows</strong> to manage complex interactions with 3rd-party EHR such as
              appointment booking, patient creation, and on-demand routing. Workflows were often hooked into Kafka
              events to trigger as a result of new messages on the queue. Additionally, leveraged the <strong>actor
                pattern</strong> for durable execution and visibility into on-demand routing logic.
            </li>
            <li>
              Implemented <strong>gRPC endpoints</strong> for appointment booking, practitioner scheduling/availability,
              and data synchronization, enabling efficient and scalable inter-service communication.
            </li>
            <li>
              Debugged and resolved a critical routing issue where status was being overwritten, enabling stable call
              routing in preparation for our <strong>production launch</strong>.
            </li>
            <li>
              Monitored and analyzed <strong>endpoint latency</strong> using <strong>Prometheus</strong> and
              <strong>Grafana</strong>, ensuring acceptable performance while scaling practitioner availability systems
              from 200 to 1,500 providers.
            </li>
            <li>
              Collaborated with another team to assess scheduling endpoint performance, proposing and validating
              fallback strategies for scalability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Identified and resolved a critical <strong>department ID mismatch</strong> during on-call duties,
              unblocking practitioners and maintaining provider trust through direct follow-up.
            </li>
            <li>
              Migrated multiple backend services to <strong>Fx</strong>, simplifying dependency injection and improving
              system maintainability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Wrote <strong>acceptance tests</strong> for practitioner availability functionality, ensuring reliable and
              consistent operations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Used an in-house test harness to establish groundwork for on-demand routing acceptance tests, enabling
              future readiness despite current infrastructure limitations.
            </li>
            <li>
              Ensured high-quality unit testing, achieving an <strong>80% test coverage threshold</strong> for key
              services. Used <strong>Mockery</strong> to create mocks when writing unit tests, ensuring robust and
              isolated testing of individual components.
            </li>
            <li>
              Maintained system health with <strong>OpsLevel</strong>, <strong>Dependabot</strong>, and
              <strong>Rollbar</strong>, reducing <strong>MTTR</strong> for critical production issues.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p class="entry-subtitle">🚀 Clinical Engineering Team</p>
          <p>
            Contributed to transforming clinical workflows and enhancing the provider and patient experience through
            innovative tools and efficient backend systems. Over six years, collaborated with cross-functional teams to
            deliver solutions that supported high-quality care delivery.

                Framework</strong>, enabling providers to access and manage patient information efficiently.
            </li>
            <li>
              Developed automation workflows with <strong>Celery</strong>, including <strong>member health
                summaries</strong> integration for patient preparation and <strong>autocoding medications and
                allergies</strong>, significantly reducing manual overhead and ensuring data accuracy.
            </li>
            <li>
              Upgraded email communication systems from <strong>SendGrid</strong> to <strong>ExactTarget</strong>,
              improving reliability and scalability.
            </li>
            <li>
              Serialized <strong>clinical data snapshots</strong> into the database during chart sign-off, ensuring
              reliable and accurate historical record-keeping.
            </li>
            <li>

                  status, improving care continuity during emergencies, absences, or transitions.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 2</strong>: Expanded Chart Access to care coordinators, improving their ability to
                  assist providers and manage patient cases.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 3</strong>: Scoped and planned the <strong>Unified Encounter Service</strong>,
                  creating a foundation to unify legacy and video visit encounters under a single system with unique
                  identifiers for all past and future visits.</li>
                <li><strong>Phase 4</strong>: Unimplemented, however, planned and scoped the association of all past and
                  future <strong>Lab Orders, Radiology</strong>, and <strong>Prescriptions</strong> with the Unified
                  Encounter, eliminating redundant references in the database and ensuring seamless integration across
                  systems.</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
