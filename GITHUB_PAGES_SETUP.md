# Manual GitHub Pages Setup Instructions

Since the automatic setup may need manual configuration, here are the step-by-step instructions:

## Step 1: Enable GitHub Pages

1. Go to your repository: https://github.com/smithclint/waypoint-media-site
2. Click on **Settings** (tab at the top)
3. Scroll down to **Pages** in the left sidebar
4. Under **Source**, select **GitHub Actions** (not Deploy from a branch)
5. The workflow file we created (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) will handle deployment

## Step 2: Verify Deployment

1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your repository
2. You should see "Deploy to GitHub Pages" workflows running
3. Wait for the green checkmark indicating successful deployment

## Step 3: Access Your Site

Your site will be available at:

- **GitHub URL**: https://smithclint.github.io/waypoint-media-site
- **Custom Domain**: https://waypointmediapro.com (after DNS setup)

## Step 4: Configure Custom Domain (Optional)

If you want to use `waypointmediapro.com`:

### In GitHub:

1. Go to **Settings** → **Pages**
2. Under **Custom domain**, enter: `waypointmediapro.com`
3. Check **Enforce HTTPS**
4. Save

### DNS Configuration:

Set up these DNS records with your domain provider:

```
Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.108.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.109.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.110.153

Type: A
Name: @
Value: 185.199.111.153
```

For www subdomain (optional):

```
Type: CNAME
Name: www
Value: smithclint.github.io
```

## Step 5: Wait for Propagation

- GitHub Pages: Usually live within a few minutes
- DNS changes: Can take up to 24-48 hours to propagate globally

## Troubleshooting

### If the workflow fails:

1. Check the Actions tab for error messages
2. Ensure the repository is public (or you have GitHub Pro for private repos)
3. Verify the workflow file syntax

### If the site doesn't load:

1. Check that Pages is enabled in Settings
2. Verify the correct source is selected (GitHub Actions)
3. Ensure index.html exists in the repository root

### Custom domain issues:

1. Verify DNS settings with your provider
2. Use online DNS checkers to verify propagation
3. Make sure HTTPS is enforced in Pages settings

## Current Repository Status

✅ GitHub Actions workflow configured
✅ .nojekyll file added (disables Jekyll)
✅ CNAME file present with your domain
✅ All HTML files formatted and validated
✅ Repository structure ready for deployment

The site should automatically deploy whenever you push to the main branch!
